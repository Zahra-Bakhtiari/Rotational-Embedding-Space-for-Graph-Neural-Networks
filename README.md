Designing the right embedding space for a neural network has tremendous implications for model expressivity, flexibility, and accuracy. This is especially true of knowledge graphs, which contain various type of relationships but are notoriously incomplete. In this post, we provide a gentle introduction to knowledge graphs and explain how one clever GNN model achieved state-of-the-art results by approaching the embedding space in a novel way.
